# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project

For this project, our customer detected that the file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically on reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders as its appears to have been altered. In order to fix and set the correct data, our customer asked us to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Also, we'll provide insights to support our customer to get clear results


## Results

As a first step, what we did was to replace the 9th grade scores for reading and mathematics with NaN in order to repeat the School District Analysis.

As resulted we can see the new acg for reading and math scores and the % of each of them with a final overall passing %.
